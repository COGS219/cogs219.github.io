    "\n",
    "**General instructions**\n",
    "- To work on this assignment, please create a GitHub folder called `stroop-experiment` and create a .py file called `stroop.py` using the starter code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Then, for each task, please create (at least) one separate GitHub commit so that I can see your history of updating your code base.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Solution code is provided beneath each exercise, but I encourage you to first try to figure out the code and experiment a bit at each step yourself, knowing that you can always \"check\" the correct answer at any point. The more you practice actually trying to generate (and type out) the code, the more effective the assignment will be at building your psychopy skills."
